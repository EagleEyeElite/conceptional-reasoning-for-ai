# Abstract
Discovers global maxima in reinforcement learning by first identifying abstract concepts, then optimizing within this reduced conceptual space. By mimicking human reasoning patterns, the approach navigates complex problems more efficiently than traditional methods that search across the full parameter space.

# Getting Started
```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate mountain-car
  python mountain_car.py
```
